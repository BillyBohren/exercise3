1. Concurrency and scalability

Implement load balancing with Kubernetes or a gRPC proxy like Envoy.

Horizontal scaling with multiple instances of the UserService.

Using an efficient connection pool for gRPC with Netty.

2. Communication between services

Synchronous gRPC for low-latency interactions between microservices.

Asynchronous messaging with Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for events like user_created or order_placed.

3. Data consistency

Implement caching in Redis to reduce the load on the database.

Using ACID transactions in PostgreSQL or NoSQL databases as required.

Database replication for greater availability.

4. Error and retry handling

Implement Circuit Breaker patterns with Resilience4j to avoid cascading failures.

Retries and exponential backoff in failed gRPC calls.

Centralized logs and monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana.

5. Deployment

Containerization with Docker.

Orchestration with Kubernetes in the cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure).

CI/CD with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated deployments.

6. High-level architecture


7. Scalability approach

Using load balancers and multiple instances to handle the load.
Cache implementation to improve response speed.

Read/write separation in the database to optimize performance, can be using a CQRS.

8. Failure and retry strategy

Implementation of Circuit Breaker for calls to external services.

Active monitoring with alerts to detect failures in real time.
